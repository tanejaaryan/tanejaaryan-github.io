I am a MSCS (fully funded thesis-track) student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am working with [Prof. Deepak Vasisht](https://deepakv.web.illinois.edu/). I also received the prestigious [J.N TATA Scholarship for Higher Education](https://jntataendowment.org) for my education. 

My research interests broadly span Systems for LLMs, Computer Networking and Machine Learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects that involve LLM inference and training optimisations, satellite networks and edge computing for video streaming.  

Previously, I worked at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) for ~2 years where I got the opportunity to work with many amazing people who are also my mentors - [Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/), [Debopam Bhattacherjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/debopamb/), and [Rohan Gandhi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rohangandhi/). I have also interned at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) where I worked in the Engineering Development Group.

Before joining Microsoft, I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I worked with [Prof. Arani Bhattacharya](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arani/), [Prof. Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/), [Prof. Koteswar Rao](https://sites.google.com/site/koteswarraojerripothula/) and [Prof. Mukulika Maity](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~mukulika/) for my undergraduate research & thesis.
